## TLDR

Prints the difference in files in both folders:
`py file_copy.py ./a/ ./b/`

Copies files from a to b:
`py file_copy.py ./a/ ./b/ -c`

Copies files from a to b that contain in the title .txt:
`py file_copy.py ./a/ ./b/ -ce .txt`

Copies files from a to b that contain in the title .txt and then deletes the files that have been copied with the correct sizes:
`py file_copy.py ./a/ ./b/ -cde .txt`

Deletes the files in a that also exist in b with the same size and title, the i ignores the deletition warning:
`py file_copy.py ./a/ ./b/ -di`
